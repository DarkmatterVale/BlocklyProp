h1. Wait

Make the cog wait for a time until a given condition.

* Until the system counter has a given value: "waitcnt":#waitcnt
* Until I/O pin(s) match designated state(s): "waitpeq":#waitpeq
* Until I/O pin(s) do not match designated state(s): "waitpne":#waitpne
* Until the video generator is ready to receive data: "waitvid":#waitvid

h2(#waitcnt). waitcnt

waitcnt will prevent the cog from executing further code until the moment the System Counter equals the value of the passed variable value ( it needs to be a number ). This is a special command because it runs unique "wait" hardware in the cog and reduces 7/8ths of the cog's power consumption. Below is an example of how to use the waitcnt command. All you need to do is drop the block into your program and add a numerical value.
